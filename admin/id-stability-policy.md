# Video ID Stability Policy

## Core Principle

Once a video has been assigned an ID (e.g., V001, V002, etc.), that ID must **never** be changed, even if:

1. The video content is updated
2. The video is moved between solution categories
3. The video title or description changes
4. The video file is replaced with a newer version

## Purpose

The ID serves as a permanent, stable identifier that ensures all references to the video remain valid over time. This includes:
- Links from documentation
- References in training materials
- External links from customer communications
- Analytics tracking

## Handling Deprecated Videos

If a video needs to be completely replaced or removed, its ID should be marked as deprecated rather than reassigned to a new video.

## Assigning New Video IDs

New videos should always be assigned the next available ID in the sequence, currently starting with V013.

## Example

If "PO Matching" (V002) needs to be moved from "Accounts Payable Solutions" to another category, it would still retain its V002 ID. Only its placement in the documentation structure would change.
